	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>The Chinese Communication Association (CCA) is a nonprofit professional and academic organization registered and headquartered in the United States. Founded in 1990, CCA is the oldest international professional society aiming to promote, enhance, and facilitate scholarly activities and exchanges on Chinese communication, which is broadly defined to embrace any aspect of communication studies concerning mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan.</p>
	<h2>President's Message</h2>
	<p>I am both honored and excited to have the opportunity to serve as President of the Chinese Communication Association for 2017-19. For the last twenty years, CCA has been home to Chinese communication scholars and those interested in Chinese communication around the world. At this time of technological advances when timely information is truly valued, our collective work to extend understanding of communication has never been more important.</p>

		<p>Twenty years ago, we might be able to account for all Chinese scholars in communication in the United States. Today, we struggle to remember the names of our own graduates. The changes in mainland China is even more astonishing. Chances are that you see a communication department, school, or college in almost every university, something we did not see in the past.</p>
		<p>When I talk to our counterparts in China, I am often pleasantly surprised by their innovativeness, originality, and creativity. But at the same time, as these communication programs prosper and scholars mature, they are also vying for prestige, often realized by recognized scholarship such as SSCI publications. So the landscape is different. Changing educational and scholarship needs call for greater CCA involvement and they are fundamentally changing CCA’s missions and services. Our students, colleagues and institutions need us now more than ever. Our services are built on clear vision, flexible approaches, and adapting to the changing needs of our contexts</p>
