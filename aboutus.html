	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<p>The Chinese Communication Association (CCA) is a nonprofit professional and academic organization registered and headquartered in the United States. Founded in 1990, CCA is the oldest international professional society aiming to promote, enhance, and facilitate scholarly activities and exchanges on Chinese communication, which is broadly defined to embrace any aspect of communication studies concerning mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan.</p>
	<h2>President's Message</h2>
	<p>I am both honored and excited to have the opportunity to serve as President of the Chinese Communication Association for 2017-19. For the last twenty years, CCA has been home to Chinese communication scholars and those interested in Chinese communication around the world. At this time of technological advances when timely information is truly valued, our collective work to extend understanding of communication has never been more important.</p>

		<p>Twenty years ago, we might be able to account for all Chinese scholars in communication in the United States. Today, we struggle to remember the names of our own graduates. The changes in mainland China is even more astonishing. Chances are that you see a communication department, school, or college in almost every university, something we did not see in the past.</p>
		<p>When I talk to our counterparts in China, I am often pleasantly surprised by their innovativeness, originality, and creativity. But at the same time, as these communication programs prosper and scholars mature, they are also vying for prestige, often realized by recognized scholarship such as SSCI publications. So the landscape is different. Changing educational and scholarship needs call for greater CCA involvement and they are fundamentally changing CCA’s missions and services. Our students, colleagues and institutions need us now more than ever. Our services are built on clear vision, flexible approaches, and adapting to the changing needs of our contexts</p>
		<p>We have exciting years ahead. In the next two years, I will be working with the CCA Executive Committee and membership to continue advancing the priorities set out in our mission. Below, I note a few special areas of emphasis:</p>
		<li>We will organize an Asian Communication Conference to reflect the past, examine the current status of Asian communication, in particular, Chinese communication, and to envision the future. A task force has been assembled with representatives from Korea, Japan, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. We will try to make it a reality. After that, the hope is to rotate the hosting duties between Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, and the like.</li>
		<li>We will collaborate with journal editors to establish stronger ties with them and to collect more CCA affiliated journals. This is a win-win situation. Often journal editors need reviewers and contributors. CCA’s talents serves them well. On the other hand, CCA members can benefit from publications venues and opportunities with these journals.</li>
		<li>We will utilize online technologies to its fullest in serving our members. A number of webinars on various relevant topics, research, teaching or service related, will be featured to help our members navigate academic life.</li>
		<li>We will establish three conference co-chairs to help the Vice President with conference paper reviews and organization. As CCA grows, our membership also grows, and that workload for the research chair is often ominous. This will help greatly alleviate and facilitate our conference organization. It also offers opportunities for many more executive members to get more involved.</li>
		<p>CCA exists to support the work of our membership. Our collective work is an important part of the social fabric of our community and discipline. Our discipline the global context in which it is situated is changing more quickly than ever before and our approaches need to adapt. CCA wants to be a critical player in helping our discipline. It is clear that there has never been a more exciting time for CCA to contribute. I look forward to helping advance communication as a discipline and Chinese communication in particular, and supporting those who work in this area through scholarship, professional development and fellowship.</p>
